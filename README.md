Skin diseases are a common but often overlooked health issue in domestic cats, frequently resulting in delayed treatment and suffering due to misdiagnosis or lack of access to veterinary care. This study presents a deep learning-based solution for automated classification of cat skin conditions into three categories: bacterial infections, fungal infections, and healthy skin. We employed the pretrained MobileNetV2 architecture with a fine-tuned classifier for lightweight, accurate image classification, optimized using cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. We have used data augmentation and resizing techniques to improve generalizability, and the model that was trained using PyTorch on images resized to 224×224 pixels. On evaluation, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 94%, with an F1-score of 0.93, outperforming many existing approaches in this domain. In contrast, our work uses a lightweight yet powerful architecture (MobileNetV2) suitable for mobile deployment. It applies a statistically balanced dataset with train-validation-test splits. It provides comprehensive statistical metrics (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix) which requires minimal preprocessing or expert feature extraction, making it accessible and reproducible.

1. INTRODUCTION
Skin disorders are among the most common medical concerns in domestic cats, often manifesting as itching, inflammation, hair loss, or lesions. These conditions can be caused by a variety of factors, including bacterial and fungal infections, parasites, and allergic reactions. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to prevent complications and ensure effective treatment. However, access to veterinary dermatological expertise is limited in many regions, leading to delayed or incorrect diagnosis. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on clinical experience and laboratory tests, which are time-consuming, costly, and not always accessible to pet owners [1]. Model performance was assessed using key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to analyse class-wise performance. The final model achieved an accuracy of makes the system suitable for mobile and edge devices, enhancing its practical applicability in real-world, resource-constrained environments [2].
Nutritional deficiencies, particularly in early feline development, can significantly affect skin health by weakening immune response and increasing sensitivity to infections, especially in developing regions where access to animal-based food sources is limited [3]. While majorly studies have been conducted on canine dermatological conditions, similar skin disorders are prevalent among feline populations as well. For example, an epidemiological study in Uganda on dogs revealed a high incidence of bacterial, parasitic, and fungal skin infections, which often parallel common dermatological issues in domestic cats [4]. Chronic skin diseases like atopic dermatitis have been analyzed over increased clinical periods, indicating that both environmental allergens and genetic susceptibility play significant roles in the indication of long-term skin conditions [5]. The veterinary field has gradually evolved from a mainly experience-based practice to a more technology-driven discipline, including advanced diagnostic tools and data-driven decision-making for improved accuracy and early detection of diseases [6]. Furthermore, computational methods such as Unclear thinking have been worked to identify feline skin conditions based on unclear input symptoms, laying foundational work for the later combination of machine learning techniques despite their limitations in adaptability and generalization [7].
2. BACKGROUND STUDY
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an essential component in modern veterinary diagnostics, particularly in the field of feline disease detection through image-based analysis. Recent studies emphasize the need to balance high diagnostic performance with  understandability to foster clinical acceptance. One approach include clarity into AI models by using saliency mapping techniques along with clinical feedback, enhancing the transparency of prediction outputs [8]. Advances in model architecture have also played a significant role, transformer-based designs such as Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated superior performance in multi-class classification tasks compared to standard complex models [9]. In parallel, the fusion of multimodal data, particularly thermal and RGB imaging, has shown to significantly improve early disease identification by capturing supportive visual prompt[10]. Addressing the limitations of labeled datasets, self-supervised learning frameworks have appear as effective alternatives for learning strong features from unlabeled data, offering potential improvements in environments with limited explained samples [11]. Synthetic data generation using generative pretraining methods has further contributed to overcoming data scarcity and class imbalance, supporting more balanced model training [12]. Additionally, scalable AI platforms designed for remote feline health screening have demonstrated the practicality of lightweight, deployable models for use in low-resource or mobile environments [13]. These combined developments provide a strong foundation and motivation for our project, which aims to implement an efficient, explainable, and accessible image classification model for feline skin disease detection.
3.RELATED WORKS
In the domain of feline disease detection, multiple machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed, with a particular emphasis on image-based diagnosis. Our study builds upon a range of research contributions that have utilized handcrafted features, deep neural networks, and hybrid systems to enhance classification accuracy for feline disorders, especially skin-related conditions [14]. Some of the most relevant studies are summarized below:
Singh et al. [15] developed an early-stage classification system using handcrafted features and decision tree algorithms for identifying feline skin diseases. Although the model demonstrated basic predictive capabilities, its dependency on manually extracted features limited its adaptability and effectiveness across varying image types.  
Subsequently, Kumar and Patel [16] introduced a CNN-based classifier employing transfer learning on feline disease datasets. Their model performed reasonably well; however, it lacked detailed performance metrics and suffered from class imbalance, leading to concerns over its hardiness in real-world scenarios.
Awasthi et al. [17] focused on fungal infections in cats, again relying on handcrafted features. While the study reported decent accuracy, the approach required expert involvement for feature selection, which hindered its generalization to new or diverse datasets.
Zhao et al. [18] proposed an innovative audio signal-based detection model for feline respiratory disorders. While this study expanded the modality of disease detection, it diverged from image-based diagnostics and was not applicable for visual symptoms such as skin lesions.
Li and Huang [19] introduced a hybrid framework integrating YOLOv5 and CNN-LSTM architectures for tracking abnormal behaviour in cats via video data. Although effective in behavioural detection, the system required high computational resources and continuous video streams, making it unsuitable for lightweight, mobile-friendly applications targeting dermatological symptoms.
Hence, building upon the limitations of prior research, we propose a lightweight, image-based classification system using MobileNetV2 optimized for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our model aims to bridge the gap between efficiency and diagnostic accuracy for feline skin diseases [20].
4.MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY
Datasets
This study utilizes the Cat Skin Disease v2 datasets, publicly available on Kaggle [21], which provides a structured and annotated collection of feline skin disease images. The datasets was specifically created to aid in the development of automated diagnostic tools for skin-related conditions in cats using computer vision and deep learning [22].
1) Datasets Composition and Classes
The datasets comprises over 1,000 JPEG images of domestic cats, each annotated with a confirmed visible dermatological condition. Images are organized into distinct folders, each representing a disease class, namely: ringworm (dermatophytosis) with characteristic circular alopecia and crusting; mange and scabies caused by mites leading to erythema and fur loss; Lynxacarus infestation showing small reddish granules and patchy coat; and other dermatological anomalies such as dermatitis, inflammation, or pigmentation irregularities. This folder-based structure ensures clear class separation and straightforward integration into supervised learning pipelines [23]
2) Data Quality and Annotation
The datasets was compiled from multiple sources, including veterinary case archives, curated online databases, and collections verified by subject-matter experts. Wherever possible, image labels were cross-checked against supplementary clinical descriptions or references from veterinary literature. While pixel-level annotations or bounding boxes are not provided, the datasets contains reliable image-level class labels, which are sufficient for end-to-end CNN classification. Variations in lighting, background, fur color, and image resolution introduce natural diversity, thereby improving the robustness of the model for real-world diagnostic applications, including mobile and field-based use cases [24].
3) Preprocessing and Augmentation
To standardize inputs and expand dataset diversity, a comprehensive preprocessing and augmentation pipeline was implemented. All images were resized to 224×224 pixels to match the MobileNetV2 input requirements, and pixel values were normalized to the [0, 1] range for stable training convergence. Data augmentation techniques included random rotations (±15°), zoom adjustments (0.8–1.2 range), horizontal flips, contrast and brightness shifts, as well as minor shearing and cropping. These transformations reduce overfitting and improve model resilience to minor distortions, ensuring better generalization to unseen data.
4) Dataset Partitioning
After augmentation, the final balanced datasets consisted of 1,170 samples, evenly distributed across disease classes. The datasets was split into training (80%, 936 images), validation (10%, 117 images), and test (10%, 117 images) subsets. A stratified sampling strategy was employed to preserve class proportions across all partitions, ensuring unbiased performance evaluation and consistent representation of each condition.

5.RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
This section presents a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the system's performance in terms of standard classification metrics, class-wise effectiveness, and visual assessment of correct predictions.
A. Quantitative Evaluation
The classification performance of the MobileNetV2-based model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The macro-averaged F1-score reached 0.93, indicating strong performance across all categories. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 94.7%, as reported in Table IV.
Table 2: Classification Metrics for Each Disease Class



Fig. 5. F1-Score Comparison Across Disease Classes
All classes exceed an F1-score of 0.7, demonstrating the model's balanced discriminative capacity across disease categories, particularly where symptoms are visually prominent.
B. Confusion Matrix Analysis
The confusion matrix (Fig. 7) provides a granular view of true versus predicted labels. The matrix confirms minimal misclassification, with most predictions lying along the diagonal.
Fig 6. Confusion Matrix for Test Set
Notably, occasional confusion was observed between scabies and generalized dermatitis, likely due to overlapping visual features such as redness and fur loss. However, the error rates were within acceptable thresholds and did not substantially affect diagnostic reliability.Hence, The ability to generalize over different lighting conditions, fur colours, and backgrounds confirms the robustness of the MobileNetV2 backbone and the effectiveness of the applied augmentation techniques.
6.CONCLUSION
This research presents an efficient and accurate deep learning-based model for the classification of feline skin conditions, specifically targeting bacterial infections, fungal infections, and healthy skin. Utilizing the pretrained MobileNetV2 architecture, the model was fine-tuned to perform image classification with minimal computational overhead, achieving a high accuracy of 94% and an F1-score of 0.93. The model was trained on a statistically balanced dataset with appropriate train-validation-test splits, using standard preprocessing techniques such as image resizing and data augmentation to enhance generalization. Unlike traditional diagnostic methods or rule-based systems that often require extensive domain expertise or handcrafted features, the proposed solution offers an end-to-end automated pipeline requiring minimal preprocessing. Its lightweight design ensures suitability for mobile and edge device deployment, thus enabling real-time disease detection in resource-limited or remote environments. This work contributes a scalable, accessible, and duplicable framework to the field of AI-driven veterinary diagnostics and establishes a solid foundation for future enhancements in explainability and multi-class disease recognition.
